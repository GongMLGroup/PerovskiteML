Description: The stack sequence describing the cell. The following guidelines apply
Start with the substrate to the left and list the materials in each layer of the device
Every layer should be separated by a space, a vertical bar, and a space, i.e. (‘ | ‘)
If two materials, e.g. A and B, are mixed in one layer, list the materials in alphabetic order and separate them with semicolons, as in (A; B)
The perovskite layer is stated as “Perovskite”, regardless of composition, mixtures, dimensionality
etc. There are plenty of other fields specifically targeting the perovskite.
If a material is doped, or have an additive, state the pure material here and specify the doping in the columns specifically targeting the doping of those layers.

Concerns: Is considered a primary descriptor of a cell. It could happen that more than one label can refer to the same thing.

Cell_area_total Format: Float. [cm^2] Default: nan
Implemented: After the initial data hunt but before initial release

Format: Integer Default: 0
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: The number of individual solar cells, or pixels, on the substrate on which the reported cell is made

Cell_architecture Format: Text string Default: “Unknown”

Description: The cell architecture with respect to the direction of current flow and the order in which layers are deposited. The two most common are nip (also referred to as normal) and pin (also referred to as inverted) but there are also a few others, e.g. Back contacted
nip architecture means that the electrons are collected at the substrate side. The typical example is when a TiO2 electron selective contact is deposited between the perovskite and the substrate (e.g. SLG | FTO | TiO2-c |Perovskite | …)
pin architecture means that it instead is the holes that are collected at the substrate side. The typical example is when a PEDOT:PSS hole selective contact is deposited between the perovskite and the substrate (e.g. SLG | FTO | PEDOT:PSS |Perovskite | …)

Cell_flexible
Format: Boolean. i.e. TRUE or FALSE Default: FALSE
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: TRUE if the cell flexible and bendable.
Concerns: This does not discriminate between different levels of flexibility

Description: The minimum bending radius possible without degrading the cells performance

Cell_semitransparent
Format: Boolean. i.e. TRUE or FALSE Default: FALSE
Implemented: In the original data hunt

Description: The total area of the module in cm2. This includes scribes, contacts, boundaries, etc. and represent the module’s geometrical footprint.
Concerns: Sometimes mixed up with effective area

Module_area_effective Format: Float [cm^2] Default: nan
Implemented: In the original data hunt Description: The active area of the module in cm2.

Module_JV_data_recalculated_per_cell Format: Boolean. i.e. TRUE or FALSE Default: FALSE
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: The preferred way to report IV data for modules is to recalculate the IV data to average data per sub-cells in the module. That simplifies downstream comparisons, and it ensures that there is no erroneous transformation that otherwise may occur when error checking the IV data. Mark this as TRUE if the conversation is done. In the historical dataset, this transformation has been done for all cells.
Potentials should be reported in V but it happens that people report it in mV, and to deal with that problem, all potential values over a threshold indicating that it probably is stated in mV is divided by 1000. For series interconnected modules, the total module potential can be over that threshold, so if data not is calculated per cell, this could be wrong with a factor 1000.

Substrate
Substrate_stack_sequence
Format: Text string. [Mat.1; Mat.2; ... | Mat.3; ... | Mat.4 | ...]
Default: “Unknown”
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: The stack sequence describing the substrate.
With the substrate, we refer to any layer below the electron transport layer in a nip-device, and any layer below the hole transport layer in a pin-device.
Every layer should be separated by a space, a vertical bar, and a space, i.e. (‘ | ‘)
If two materials, e.g. A and B, are mixed in one layer, list the materials in alphabetic order and separate them with semicolons, as in (A; B)
Use common abbreviations when appropriate but spell it out if risk for confusion.
There are a lot of stack sequences described in the literature. Try to find your one in the list. If it is not there (i.e. you may have done something new) define a new stack sequence according to the instructions.

If there are uncertainties, state the best estimate, e.g. write 100 and not 90-110
If you only know the total thickness, e.g. you have a 2 mm thick commercial FTO substrate and you do not know how thick the FTO layer is, state that as ‘2 | nan’

Substrate_area Format: Float. [cm^2] Default: nan

this as “lab made”
If the supplier is unknown, stat that as: ‘Unknown’
This category was included after the projects initial phase wherefor the list of reported categories is short. Thus, be prepared to expand the given list of alternatives in the data template.

Every layer should be separated by a space, a vertical bar, and a space, i.e. (‘ | ‘)
Make sure that you describe as many layers as there are layers in the stack. Otherwise it will be difficult to interpret which layer the deposition procedure is referring to. It should thus be as many vertical bars in this field as when describing the substrate stack.
When more than one reaction step, separate them by a double forward angel bracket with one blank
space on both sides (‘ >> ‘)
If the deposition procedure for a layer unknown, state that as: ‘Unknown’
If a substrate is bought commercially and you do not know, indicate this by the label “Commercial”

Refers to the cleaning of the entire substrate before the deposition of the rest of the cell stack starts.
If there is more than one cleaning step involved, separate the steps by a double forward angel

Format: Text string. [Mat.1; Mat.2; ... | Mat.3; ... | Mat.4 | ...]
Default: “Unknown”
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: The stack sequence describing the electron transport layer. Use the following formatting guidelines
With the ETL, we refer to any layer between the substrate and the perovskite in a nip-device, and any layer between the perovskite and the back contact in a pin-device.
Every layer should be separated by a space, a vertical bar, and a space, i.e. (‘ | ‘)
If two materials, e.g. A and B, are mixed in one layer, list the materials in alphabetic order and separate them with semicolons, as in (A; B)
If no electron transport layer, state that as ‘non’
Use common abbreviations when appropriate but spell it out if risk for confusion.
If a material is doped, or have an additive, state the pure material here and specify the doping in the columns specifically targeting the doping of those layers.
There is no sharp well-defined boundary between when a material is best considered as doped or as a mixture of two materials. When in doubt if your material is best described as doped or as a mixture, use the notation that best capture the metaphysical essence of the situation.

ETL_thickness
Format: Text string. [Th.1 | Th.2 | … | Th.n ] [nm]
Default: nan
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: A list of thicknesses of the individual layers in the stack. Every layer should be separated by a
space, a vertical bar, and a space, i.e. (‘ | ‘)
The layers must line up with the previous filed.
State thicknesses in nm
Every layer in the stack has a thickness. If it is unknown, state this as ‘nan’
If there are uncertainties, state the best estimate, e.g. write 100 and not 90-110

ETL_additives_compounds
Format: Text string. [Addt.1; Addt.2; ... | Addt.3; … | Addt.4 | ... ]
Default: Empty text string Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: List of the dopants and additives that are in each layer of the ETL-stack
Every layer should be separated by a space, a vertical bar, and a space, i.e. (‘ | ‘)
The layers must line up with the previous fields.
If several dopants/additives, e.g. A and B, are present in one layer, list the dopants/additives in alphabetic order and separate them with semicolons, as in (A; B)
If no dopants/additives, state that as “Undoped”
If the doping situation is unknown, stat that as: ‘Unknown’
Concerns: This is a category with a lot of uncertainty. Historically a lot of dopants have not been added properly. A blank field may thus not guarantee that the layer was undoped. Sometimes it has been a confusion if something should be treated as a dopant, or an extra layer, or a part of the previous layer and just involve an extra deposition step for that layer. An example is TiCl4 treatment of TiO2

ETL_additives_concentrations
Format: Text string. [c1 M; c2 wt%; … | c3 vol%; ... | c4 mg/ml | ...] Default: nan
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: The concentration of the dopants/additives.
Every layer should be separated by a space, a vertical bar, and a space, i.e. (‘ | ‘)

For each dopant/additive in the layer, state the concentration.
The order of the dopants/additives must be the same as in the previous filed.
For layers with no dopants/additives, state this as ‘none’
When concentrations are unknown, state that as ‘nan’
Concentrations can be stated in different units suited for different situations. Therefore, specify the unit used.
The preferred way to state the concentration of a dopant/additive is to refer to the amount in the final product, i.e. the material in the layer. When possible, use on the preferred units:
wt%, mol%, vol%, ppt, ppm, ppb
When the concentration of the dopant/additive in the final product is unknown, but where the concentration of the dopant/additive in the solution is known, state that concentration instead. When possible, use on the preferred units:
M, mM, molal; g/ml, mg/ml, µg/ml
For values with uncertainties, state the best estimate, e.g. write 4 wt% and not 3-5 wt%. Concerns: In the initial instructions, concentrations should be stated as fraction of total amount, but that was ambiguous and was interpreted differently.

Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: The deposition procedures for the ETL stack.
Every layer should be separated by a space, a vertical bar, and a space, i.e. (‘ | ‘)
When more than one reaction step, separate them by a double forward angel bracket with one blank
space on both sides (‘ >> ‘)
Thermal annealing is generally not considered as an individual reaction step. The philosophy behind this is that every deposition step has a thermal history, which is specified in a separate filed. In exceptional cases with thermal annealing procedures clearly disconnected from other procedures, state ‘Thermal annealing’ as a separate reaction step.
Please read the instructions under “Perovskite. Deposition. Procedure” for descriptions and distinctions between common deposition procedures and how they should be labelled for consistency in the database.
Concerns: Much effort was put to make this correct in the original dataset, but it happens that we have misunderstood the descriptions in the original publications.

When more than one reaction step, separate the aggregation state associated to each reaction step
by a double forward angel bracket with one blank space on both sides (‘ >> ‘)
Most cases are clear cut, e.g. spin-coating involves species in solution and evaporation involves species in gas phase. For less clear-cut cases, consider where the reaction really is happening as in:
For a spray-coating procedure, it is droplets of liquid that enters the substrate (thus a liquid phase reaction)
For sputtering and thermal evaporation, it is species in gas phase that reaches the substrate (thus a gas phase reaction)

ETL_deposition_synthesis_atmosphere
Format: Text string. [Gas1; Gas2 >> Gas3; ... >> ... | Gas4 >> … | Gas5 | ... ]

“Ambient” represents air where the relative humidity is not known. For ambient conditions where the relative humidity is known, state this as “Air”
“Vacuum” (of unspecified pressure) is for this purpose considered as an atmospheric gas
This category was included after the projects initial phase wherefor the list of reported categories is short. Thus, be prepared to expand the given list of alternatives in the data template.

Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: TRUE if the cell is based on a perovskite quantum dots. Perovskite nanoparticle architectures can also be counted here unless they more have the characteristics of a standard polycrystalline cell

Format: Boolean. i.e. TRUE or FALSE Default: FALSE
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: TRUE if the cell is based on 2D perovskites, i.e. a layered perovskite with a large A-cation Concerns: This distinction was not made in the initial instructions, which means that some 2D cells may be marked as False, but as dimensionality often can be deduced from the composition this should not be a big problem

Perovskite_dimension_2D3D_mixture Format: Boolean. i.e. TRUE or FALSE Default: FALSE
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: TRUE if the cell is based on a mixture of 2D and 3D perovskites. This is sometimes referred to as reduced dimensional perovskites (but not as reduced as to be a pure 2D perovskite)
Concerns: This distinction was not made in the initial instructions, which means that some cells that should be here may be marked as False. It is also not always obvious from the papers if this is the case, in part because it is non-trivial to measure.

Perovskite_dimension_3D
Format: Boolean. i.e. TRUE or FALSE Default: FALSE
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: TRUE for standard three-dimensional perovskites with ABC3 structures. TRUE also for the case where the bulk of the perovskite is 3D but where there exist a thin 2D-capping layer

Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: TRUE if the bulk of the perovskite layer is 3D but there is a top layer with lower dimensionality.

Concerns: This distinction was not made in the initial instructions which means that some cells that should be here may be marked as False. It is also not always obvious from the papers if this is the case, in part because it is non-trivial to measure.

Perovskite_composition_perovskite_inspired_structure
Format: Boolean. i.e. TRUE or FALSE Default: FALSE
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: TRUE if the photo absorber does not have a perovskite structure. In the literature we sometimes see cells based on non-perovskite photo absorbers, but which claims to be “perovskite inspired” regardless if the crystal structure has any resemblance to the perovskite ABC3 structure or not. This category is for enabling those cells to easily be identified and filtered.

Default: nan
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: List of the A-site ions in the perovskite structure

List all the A-site ions in alphabetic order and separate them by semicolons
For ions which labels are three characters or longer, enclose them in parenthesis. That improves readability and simplifies downstream data treatment.
In case of a layered perovskite structure, separate layers by a space, a vertical bar, and a space, i.e. (‘
| ‘)
Only include ions that go into the perovskite structure. Ions that only are found in secondary phases, or amorphous grain boundaries, or that disappears during synthesis, should instead be added as dopants/additives in the field dedicated to dopants and additives.
On example is Rb in MAFAPbBrI-perovskites. As far as we know, Rb does not go into the perovskite structure, even if that was believed to be the case in the beginning, but rather form secondary phases. For MAFAPbBrI-perovskites, Rb should thus not be considered as a A-site cation, but as a dopant/additive.

One example is chloride in MAPbI3. As far as we know, Cl does not go into the perovskite structure even if that was believed to be the case in the beginning. For MAPbI3 Cl should thus not be considered as a C- site cation, but as a dopant/additive

Format: Text string. [Com.1; Com.2; … | Com.3; … | ...]
Default: nan
Implemented: In during the original data hunt
Description: Components that are in excess in the perovskite synthesis. E.g. to form stoichiometric MAPbI3, PbI2 and MAI are mixed in the proportions 1:1. If one of them are in excess compared to the other, then that component is considered to be in excess. This information can be inferred from data entered on the concentration for all reaction solutions, but this gives a convenient shorthand filtering option.
If more than one component is in excess, order them in alphabetic order and separate them by semicolons.
It there are no components that are in excess, write Stoichiometric

Perovskite_composition_short_form
Format: Text string Default: ‘Unknown’
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: The perovskite composition written in shorthand notation, i.e. without coefficients. Not given by users but inferred from the previous columns.

Perovskite_composition_long_form
Format: Text string Default: ‘Unknown’
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: The perovskite composition Not given by users but inferred from the previous columns. This is because it turned out to be impossible to get people to follow instructions and state the perovskite structures in a consistent and machine-readable form.

Default: nan
Implemented: After the initial data hunt but before initial release
Description: The knowledge base from which the perovskite composition is inferred. Is the assumed perovskite composition based on the composition of the precursor solutions and the assumption that the final perovskite will have the same composition (i.e. Solution composition), or is it based on literature claims (i.e. Literature) or has it been experimentally verified with some technique, e.g. XRD, EDX, XRF, etc.?

Default: Empty text string Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: List of the dopants and additives that are in the perovskite
If the perovskite is layered (e.g. 3D perovskite with a 2D capping layer), separate the layers by a
space, a vertical bar, and a space, i.e. (‘ | ‘)
If several dopants/additives, e.g. A and B, are present in one layer, list the dopants/additives in alphabetic order and separate them with semicolons: as in (A; B)
If no dopants/additives, state that as “Undoped”
If the doping situation is unknown, stat that as: ‘Unknown’
Include any non-solvent that does not go into the perovskite structure. This includes compounds that are found in secondary phases, or amorphous grain boundaries, or that disappears during synthesis.
One example is Rb in MAFAPbBrI-perovskites. As far as we know, Rb does not go into the perovskite structure, even if that was believed to be the case in the beginning, but rather form secondary phases. For MAFAPbBrI-perovskites, Rb should thus not be considered as a A-site cation, but as a dopant/additive.
One other example is chloride in MAPbI3. As far as we know, Cl does not go into the perovskite structure even if that was believed to be the case in the beginning. For MAPbI3 Cl should thus not be considered as a C-site cation, but as a dopant/additive.
Concerns: This is a category with a lot of uncertainty. Historically a lot of dopants have not been added properly. A blank field may thus not guarantee that the layer was undoped.

Perovskite_additives_concentrations
Format: Text string. [c1 M; c2 wt%; … | c3 vol%; ... | c4 mg/ml | ...]
Default: nan
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: The concentration of the dopants/additives.

For each dopant/additive in the layer, state the concentration.
The order of the dopants/additives must be the same as in the previous filed.

For layers with no dopants/additives, state this as ‘none’
When concentrations are unknown, state that as ‘nan’
Concentrations can be stated in different units suited for different situations. Therefore, specify the unit used.
The preferred way to state the concentration of a dopant/additive is to refer to the amount in the final product, i.e. the material in the layer. When possible, use on the preferred units:
wt%, mol%, vol%, ppt, ppm, ppb
When the concentration of the dopant/additive in the final product is unknown, but where the concentration of the dopant/additive in the solution is known, state that concentration instead. When possible, use on the preferred units:
M, mM, molal; g/ml, mg/ml, µg/ml
For values with uncertainties, state the best estimate, e.g. write 4 wt% and not 3-5 wt%.

State thicknesses in nm
Every layer in the stack has a thickness. If it is unknown, state this as ‘nan’
If there are uncertainties, state the best estimate, e.g. write 100 and not 90-110
For cells where the perovskite infiltrates a mesoporous scaffold, state the thickness as starting from the bottom of the infiltrated mesoporous layer to the top of the perovskite layer (i.e. include the thickness of the infiltrated mesoporous layer)
Concern. A category with a lot of uncertainty. The practice of deposition on mesoporous substrates make direct comparisons harder

Description: The method by which the band gap was estimated. The band gap can be estimated from absorption data, EQE-data, UPS-data, or it can be estimated based on literature values for the recipe, or it could be inferred from the composition and what we know of similar but not identical compositions.

Perovskite deposition
Perovskite_deposition_number_of_deposition_steps Format: Integer
Default: 0
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: The number of production steps involved in making the perovskite-stack
A spin coating program that are composed of several segments with different spin speed are still counted as one step (1)
A spin coating program involving an antisolvent step counts as a 1-step method (1).
Depositing PbI2 first and subsequently converting it to a perovskite count as a 2-step procedure (2)
Thermal annealing is considered separately. The motivation for this is that every step is considered to have its own thermal history.

Perovskite_deposition_procedure
Format: Text string. [Proc. 1 >> Proc. 2 >> ... | Proc. 3 >> … | Proc. 4 | ... ]
Default: “Unknown”
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: The deposition procedures for the perovskite block.
The perovskite stack is considered as one block/layer when we consider the synthesis. Thus, even if the perovskite is layered, consider it as one block, i.e. no vertical bars in this field
When more than one reaction step, separate them by a double forward angel bracket with one blank
space on both sides (‘ >> ‘)
There should be as many reaction steps described here as indicated in the field “Perovskite. Deposition. Number of deposition steps”
Thermal annealing is generally not considered as an individual reaction step. The philosophy behind this is that every deposition step has a thermal history, which is specified in a separate filed. In exceptional cases with thermal annealing procedures clearly disconnected from other procedures, state ‘Thermal annealing’ as a separate reaction step.
Antisolvent treatment is considered in a separate filed. The motivation for that is that it usually is conducted simultaneously as a spin-coating procedure, and thus acts as an additional aspect of reaction step already accounted for. Exception to this is if there is an antisolvent step that is distinctly separated in time, e.g. a film with a spin-coated perovskite solution is immersed in an antisolvent. In that case, this could be added as a dipp-coating event, while also being reported in the antisolvent field.
Even if the most common deposition procedures have been used for 95 % of all reported devise, do not be surprised if you do not find your deposition procedure in the list of reported deposition procedure, as the original dataset tended to use a simplified notation.
A few clarifications
Air brush spray
Deposition with something looking like an old perfume bottle. Classified as a solution technique.
Brush painting
A precursor ink is applied with a brush
CBD:

Chemical bath deposition. Refers to procedures where a film has been immersed in a solution where a reaction occurs. The typical example is when a PbI2 film is immerse in an IPA solution with MAI in which the PbI2 is converted to the perovskite.
Co-evaporation
Simultaneous evaporation from multiple sources with line of sight deposition.
CVD
Chemical vapour deposition. A gas phase process where a chemical reaction is occurring in the gas phase. If a MA-containing compound is evaporated and reacted with PbI2 where another species is released to the gas phase, it is labelled as CVD. A process where MAI in gas phase react with PbI2 in gas phase is labelled as CVD. A process where MAI or MA gas is reacting with solid PbI2 is instead labelled as a gas reaction as no chemical reaction is occurring the gas phase. Note that all reactions labelled as CVD in the literature may not be CVD even if it is conducted in a CVD reactor, and should instead be labelled as a gas reaction.
Diffusion
Solid state reaction where two solid components are mixed. E.g. solid MAI is bought in direct contact with solid PbI2
Diffusion-gas reaction
A special case. Where one compound, e.g. MAI is placed on top of another e.g. PbI2 where it is evaporated. It is thus a combination of a gas phase reaction and solid-solid diffusion.
Dipp-coating
The thing that separates dipp-coating from CBD is the occurrence of a reaction. If you have component A in solution, dip your substrate in the solution, take it up and you have component A on your substrate, then you have done a dipp-coating. If you have substance A in solution, dip your substrate in the solution, take it up and have something else than A on your substrate, you have done a CBD (e.g. PbI2 dipped in MAI/IPA which gives MAPbI3 and not MAI on the substrate)
Dropcasting
A drop is applied to a substrate where it is left to dry without any additional procedures.
Drop-infiltration
A mesoporous scaffold in which a drop of the precursor solution is infiltrated without the aid of spin-coating.
Doctor blading:
There is a family of related techniques, but if it could be described as doctor blading, that is the label to use.
Evaporation
Refers to thermal evaporation with line-of-sigh deposition. i.e. PVD
Flash evaporation
Fast evaporation (in a flash) of a perovskite that sublimes on another substrate. Line of sight deposition.
Closed space sublimation
Evaporation of a well controlled amount of substance (usually in the form of a thin film) in a small container containing the final substrate.
Gas reaction
A gas phase reaction. Not a line of sight deposition. In the typical case, MAI is evaporated and the MAI gas builds up a pressure in the reaction chamber in which it reacts with a PbI2 film forming the perovskite.
Ion exchange
One perovskite is dipped into a solution (or exposed to a gas) which leads to an ion exchange, e.g. I is replaced by Br.
Lamination
A readymade film is transferred directly to the device stack. A rather broad concept. An everyday kitchen related example of lamination would eb to place a thin plastic film over a slice of pie.

Recrystallization
A perovskite that already have been formed is deformed and then recrystallised. E.g. MAPbI3 is exposed to Methylamine gas for a short while which dissolved the perovskite which then can crystallize again
Rinsing
Cleaning step with a solvent
Sandwiching
When a readymade top stack simply is placed on top of the device stack. Could be held together with clams.
Ultrasonic spray
A bit like air brush spray but with better control of droplet size. Classified as a solution technique.

Hole transport layer
HTL_stack_sequence
Format: Text string. [Mat.1; Mat.2; ... | Mat.3; ... | Mat.4 | ...]
Default: “Unknown”
Implemented: In the original data hunt
Description: The stack sequence describing the hole transport layer. Use the following formatting guidelines
With the HTL, we refer to any layer between the substrate and the perovskite in a pin-device, and any layer between the perovskite and the back contact in a nip-device.
Every layer should be separated by a space, a vertical bar, and a space, i.e. (‘ | ‘)
If two materials, e.g. A and B, are mixed in one layer, list the materials in alphabetic order and separate them with semicolons, as in (A; B)
If no hole transport layer, state that as ‘non’
Use common abbreviations when appropriate but spell it out if risk for confusion.
If a material is doped, or have an additive, state the pure material here and specify the doping in the columns specifically targeting the doping of those layers.
There is no sharp well-defined boundary between when a material is best considered as doped or as a mixture of two materials. When in doubt if your material is best described as doped or as a mixture, use the notation that best capture the metaphysical essence of the situation.

Format: Text string. [Th.1 | Th.2 | … | Th.n ] [nm]
Default: nan

If no dopants/additives, state that as “Undoped”
If the doping situation is unknown, stat that as: ‘Unknown’
Concerns: This is a category with a lot of uncertainty. Historically a lot of dopants have not been added properly. A blank field may thus not guarantee that the layer was undoped.

For each dopant/additive in the layer, state the concentration.
The order of the dopants/additives must be the same as in the previous filed.
For layers with no dopants/additives, state this as ‘none’
When concentrations are unknown, state that as ‘nan’
Concentrations can be stated in different units suited for different situations. Therefore, specify the unit used.
The preferred way to state the concentration of a dopant/additive is to refer to the amount in the final product, i.e. the material in the layer. When possible, use on the preferred units:
wt%, mol%, vol%, ppt, ppm, ppb
When the concentration of the dopant/additive in the final product is unknown, but where the concentration of the dopant/additive in the solution is known, state that concentration instead. When possible, use on the preferred units:
M, mM, molal; g/ml, mg/ml, µg/ml
For values with uncertainties, state the best estimate, e.g. write 4 wt% and not 3-5 wt%. Concerns: In the initial instructions, concentrations should be stated as fraction of total amount, but that was ambiguous and was interpreted differently.

Thermal annealing is generally not considered as an individual reaction step. The philosophy behind this is that every deposition step has a thermal history, which is specified in a separate filed. In exceptional cases with thermal annealing procedures clearly disconnected from other procedures, state ‘Thermal annealing’ as a separate reaction step.
Please read the instructions under “Perovskite. Deposition. Procedure” for descriptions and distinctions between common deposition procedures and how they should be labelled for consistency in the database.
Concerns: Much effort was put to make this correct in the original dataset, but it happens that we have misunderstood the descriptions in the original publications.

For a spray-coating procedure, it is droplets of liquid that enters the substrate (thus a liquid phase reaction)
For sputtering and thermal evaporation, it is species in gas phase that reaches the substrate (thus a gas phase reaction)
